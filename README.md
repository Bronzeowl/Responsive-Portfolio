# bootstrap-portfolio

This is the second assignment completed for the Houston Coding Bootcamp Delivered by UT Austin.

In this assignment, we were required to create two different portfolios. The first was an update of the first assignment â€”it was enhanced with a mobile-responsive layout. For the second portfolio, we were required to build a layout with the Bootstrap CSS framework.

This repo contains the first portfolio which demonstrates the use of responsiveness.
